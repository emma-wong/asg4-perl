# CMPS 112 Assignment 4


In this assignment, you will use Perl to write a replacement for a subset of gmake.

The pmake utility executes a list of shell commands associated with each target,
typically to create or update files of the same name. The Makefile contains
entries that describe how to bring a target up to date with respect to those on
which it depends, which are called prerequisites.
